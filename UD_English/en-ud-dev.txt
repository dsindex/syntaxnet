From the AP comes this story : President Bush on Tuesday nominated two
individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington
area. Bush nominated Jennifer M. Anderson for a 15-year term as associate judge
of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, replacing Steffen W. Graae.
*** Bush also nominated A. Noel Anketell Kramer for a 15-year term as associate
judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, replacing John Montague
Steadman. 

The sheikh in wheel-chair has been attacked with a F-16-launched bomb. He could
be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons, since he founded
and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas, but they didn't. Today's incident
proves that Sharon has lost his patience and his hope in peace. Nervous people
make mistakes, so I suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks. A
la guerre c'est comme a la guerre! 

In the eastern city of Baqubah, guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a police
station, killing several people. The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile
fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland, but this time the crew was safe. In
Fallujah, hundreds of demonstrators came out against US troops when they briefly
arrested a yound newlywed bride. (I hope that the US army got an enormous amount
of information from her relatives, because otherwise this move was a bad, bad
tradeoff). The US troops fired into the hostile crowd, killing 4. It seems clear
to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being
done wrong, or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis.

Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company's story
to the (miniscule number of) people who haven't heard it. Usually, these are
just a chance for the suckups to suck up, but this time people are actually
concerned about the company's plans. They work on Wall Street, after all, so
when they hear a company who's stated goals include "Don't be evil," they
imagine a company who's eventually history will be "Don't be profitable." It's
not quite as freewheeling an environment as you'd imagine: Sergey Brin has
actually created a mathematical 'proof' that the company's self-driven research
strategy, which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their
own, is a good, respectable idea . Read the entire article; there's a punchline,
too. 

My opinion piece on the implications of Arafat's passing for al-Qaeda has
appeared at Newsday. Excerpt: "Arafat's secular nationalism was supple enough to
compromise with Israel and to imagine a two-state solution, even if the road of
negotiations remained rocky. The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied
Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped, along with terrorist attacks by
radical groups such as Hamas, to derail the peace process, which Sharon had
always opposed. Arafat's death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that
will not soon be filled. Sharon's assassination of major Hamas leaders has also
weakened authority structures in that party. If the Israelis and the Palestinian
leadership cannot find a way to reinvigorate the peace process, cells of radical
young Palestinians may grow up that look to bin Laden for their cues. Even if
local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al-Qaida out, the
festering Israeli-Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters
for al-Qaida with young Muslim men. Resolving this conflict would be the most
effective weapon the United States could deploy in its war on terror." 

Xinhua reports that a wide range of Iraqi political forces on Tuesday condemned
Sharon's murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a religious leader of Hamas, the day
before. The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah, 50 km west of Baghdad,
"condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the
coalition soldiers in Iraq." Ash-Sharq al-Awsat reports that Fallujah was closed
Tuesday in a general strike. US troops there clashed with guerrillas in a fight
that left one Iraqi dead. In Ramadi, there was a big demonstration. Radical
Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said the attack was "criminal" and that "the
Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs, that of fighting and jihad".
The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying, "It is a proof of the
emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in
the region . . . This operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the
world and would not bring peace to the region," the message claimed. Xinhua
alleged that "Many of the Iraqis, who suffer the American occupation of Iraq,
relate their case with that of the Palestinian people, under the Israeli
occupation." In an apparently unrelated incidents, some eleven Iraqis were
killed by snipers on Tuesday, including a group of police trainees in a bus near
Hilla and two police in Kirkuk. 

Ever since the first whispers about Google's IPO, most investors have feared
that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high price that, even
with a spectacularly profitable business model and some nearly flawless
execution, the price would be too high for investors to make a real profit.
We've moved on. We've grown up. Now, people wonder if Google can even survive .
That's overstating it, I know. What they wonder is whether Google can be
anything more than what it's always been -- a great search engine with some real
grass-roots support, successful by the grace of simplicity. Simplicity gave it
that blessed, laudatory lack of clutter, the efficient and effective text-based
ads, and the support of anyone with a dial-up connection. The problem is that
customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find
-- witness the fight-for-fewest-features between low-end camera companies. The
other problem? It's tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in
your focus. As the survey cited in the above-linked article shows, most Google
users don't intend to use Gmail, and Google isn't even as popular as Yahoo! and
AOL. If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky-high
valuation, Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next
keep-it-simple search engine. 

Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper
printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed? Now Iran wants to turn the
tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust.
Amazingly, these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can
expect in this new fun contest: TEHRAN (AFP) - An international contest of
cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in
Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed. "We staged
this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in," Masoud
Shojai, head of the country's "Iran Cartoon" association and the fair organizer,
said. "They can freely write anything they like about our prophet, but if one
raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison," he
added. "Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the (second
world) war, why should the Palestinians pay for it?" Shojai told the opening
ceremony of the month-long fair in Tehran's Palestine Contemporary Art Museum.
He added that around 1,100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more
than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show. He said the top three
cartoons will be announced on September 2, with the winners being awarded prizes
of 12,000, 8,000 and 5,000 dollars respectively. This cute little stunt is only
going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are. When they saw a
cartoon of their prophet, people had to die. When their precious cartoons are
released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world. 

US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday, though they were still
meeting pockets of resistance. The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of
Iraqi noncombatants, including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al-Janabi of the respected
Association of Muslim Scholars. Armed clashes broke out in several northern
Iraqi cities on Wednesday, leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul, Baiji, and
Tuz. Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in
Tikrit and Huwaijah, as well, according to az-Zaman . The battles and
demonstrations were provoked by the US assault on Fallujah. Guerrillas
threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense
Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack. Allawi's aged cousin and the man's
wife and daughter-in-law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if
the Fallujah compaign is not stopped. In Iraqi society, PM Allawi is responsible
for protecting his clan, including especially his first cousins, so this
kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him. The US
Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday, but still face pockets of resistance.
If Samarra and other cities are any guide, those pockets of resistance could go
on bedeviling the US for some time to come. The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has
more on the Sunni boycott of the elections. He reports that the Iraqi Islamic
Party, which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni
vote, is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation.
The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on
Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections.
Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault, both in
Iraq and in Washington. For some black satire on Fallujah, see Unconfirmed
Sources which has some fun with my Weblog. [Am at a conference and can't blog
much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days.] 

The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons. Al-Qaeda
wants them, Iran wants them, Russia wants the better ones, and all the US wants
is to give them all a piece of coal. For the last few years there have been
tensions with Iran’s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was
reached through the European Union that meets with the approval of the
International Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time, an Iranian Opposition
Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program. Arial
photos, loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the
group presented. Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best
nukes the world’s ever seen. President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have
new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have. With the
demand so high, the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be
the Santa of nuclear weapons. Right now that seems to be the US, EU, and IAEA.
But not always do those three agree, and not always are their decisions equal.
The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran, yet Israel, which
to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons, ranks
around fifth in nuclear strength. It is estimated that Israel has over 200
nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest
concern. North Korea’s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and
Santa seems to have already come a few years ago. It is rumored that North Korea
has at least a couple nuclear weapons. But getting past who should get them, is
who has them, and who is really close. The case against Iran has a feeling of
Déjà vu. Arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched, somewhat like
those of chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq. America cried wolf in Iraq, and
what’s scary is that sooner or later, that wolf will probably get us. 

I ran across this item on the Internet. Sooooo. The United States goes into a
war zone and evacuates a bunch of U.S. citizens (most of whom were
"dual-citizens"). Then, eschewing normal procedure, the Department of State
waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U.S. citizen. Why? To pander to
the mythical "Arab street", of course. Now, I would argue that one could have
reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in
Lebanon (considering that the country has been experiencing some form of
conflict for approximately the last 32 years). In other words, those Americans
were there by their own choice, mired in a situation that was totally
predictable. Yet we didn't charge them for the evacuation. This is unlike the
situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U.S. citizens from areas that were
hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the
Hezbollah-provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon. And what do we get
for this effort? A lawsuit. That's right, folks. The American-Arab
Discrimination Committee is suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld, charging
that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts. Here's an excerpt from the article:
Nina Chahine, 19, who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the
lawsuit, said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13. The
wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war, she
said. "We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and
all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get
home," Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit. "We were all
American citizens and there was no way that anybody helped us. No communications
nothing. I was on my way to my wedding fearing death, basically." Chahine said
her immediate family spent about $20,000 to return to Detroit via Syria and
Jordan. Dear Nina, Here's a tip: Don't get married in countries that house
illegal militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under
counter-attack! Crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue
people from dilemmas of their own making. 

Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space, this little
bit from Dan Froomkin's "White House Briefing" column in the WashPost today is
just too good to pass up (read the whole column here ): At the Ask the President
event on Friday, one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts
about his memoirs. This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question
that he hasn't anticipated. "Q Thank you -- I was wondering, there's a lot of
talk right now about memoirs being written with the former President. After you
are elected in 2004, what will your memoirs say about you, what will the title
be, and what will the main theme say? "THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that.
(Laughter.) There is a painting on my wall in the Oval -- first of all, I don't
know. I'm just speculating now. I really haven't thought about writing a book.
My life is too complicated right now trying to do my job. (Laughter.) But if --
there's a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging
up a steep cliff, and there are at least two other horsemen following. It's a
Western scene by a guy named W.H.S. Koerner called 'A Charge to Keep.' It's on
loan, by the way, from a guy named Joe O'Neill in Midland, Texas. He was the
person, he and his wife Jan, introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his
backyard in July of 1977. Four months later, we were married. So he's got a --
I'm a decision-maker and I can make good decisions. (Applause.) "And so we sang
this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer. (Laughter.) This
is not a filibuster. (Laughter.) That's a Senate term -- particularly on good
judges. (Applause.) The hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as
governor. Laura and I are Methodists. One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn. The
painting is based upon the hymn called, 'A Charge to Keep.' I have. The hymn
talks about serving something greater than yourself in life. I -- which I try to
do, as best as I possibly can. (Applause.) "The book -- I guess one way, one
thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be, I was given a charge
to keep. And I gave it all my heart, all my energy, based upon principles that
did not change once I got into the Oval Office. (Applause.)" Now that's a
rambling response. And I have to wonder: Did he forget that he already has a
memoir called "A Charge to Keep"? That was the name of his "autobiography" --
ghost-written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999. 

There has been random speculation about Google developiong a new browser and/or
acquiring Firefox. It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode. They
have acquired Urchin, Zipdash, Applied Semantics, Picasa, Blogger, and satellite
imaging company Keyhole, so why not Firefox? I have no inside information, but I
have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn
serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology
in Firefox. Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox. He announced
this in January: As of January 10, 2005, my source of income changed from The
Mozilla Foundation to Google, Inc. of Mountain View, California. My role with
Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged, I will continue
doing much the same work as I have described above - with the new goal of
successful 1.1, 1.5 and 2.0 releases. I remain devoted full-time to the
advancement of Firefox, the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general. He
also announced this in January: Welcome Darin! I just want to extend a big
"Welcome!" to Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week. 2005 is
going to rock! Darin Fisher wrote this response on January 25, 2005: Me and the
big "G" Following on the heels of Ben's annoucement yesterday, I thought I'd
post that I have joined Google as well. Like Ben, I will still be very much
involved with the Mozilla project and community :-) Posted by darin Ben made
another announcement on March 28, 2005: I want to use this opportunity to
welcome Brian Ryner to Google! Brian has been one of the most crucial elements
to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years,... Great to have you
on board! Now, none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time,
but it's an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something.
In this case, following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making
an announcement this year that formalizes the Google-Mozilla/Firefox
relationship. If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should
take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin
Sloan and Matt Thompson, with music by Aaron McLeran. In this movie Google and
Amazon (GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008. This is one
thought-provoking film. Every move Google makes brings this particular future
closer. Just one small commment - it's not possible, as far as I know, for
Google to "Aquire" Firefox. They already have rights to take it, alter it, and
release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is
about. I'm inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and
support the growth of the most popular non-Microsoft browser out there - by
taking on the leading lights in Firefox development, they're ensuring the
continued life of the project, and ensuring (not that I think they need to) that
their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development
team. It's this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source
projects alive. Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic. Thanks for the
link. Malach, What you say makes sense. Acquiring open source talent gives a
company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open
source project will go. It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring
a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and
process mis-matches. 

The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al-Sadr's movement only
three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has
to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance. How did the CPA get to
the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites, who were initially grateful
for the removal of Saddam Hussein, against the United States? Where it risks
fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously, at a time when
US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in
country? At a time when the Spanish, Thai and other contingents are already
committed to leaving, and the UN is reluctant to get involved? One answer is
that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA. State is
the body with experience in international affairs and administration. The
civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up.
Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives, most of
whom had no administrative experience, no Arabic, and no respect for Muslim
culture (or knowledge about it). They actively excluded State Department Iraq
hands like Tom Warrick. (Only recently have a few experienced State Department
Arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess.) The Neocons in
the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to
impose on the Iraqi people, including Polish-style economic shock therapy, some
sort of sweetheart deal for Israel, and maybe even breaking the country up into
three parts. The Washington Monthly's Who's Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain
the extreme incompetence and possibly double-dealing of many in the CPA. Sept.
11 Commission member Philip Zelikow, who is close to the Bush administration,
admitted on Sept. 10, 2002, that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration
for the Iraq War was to "protect Israel," according to the Asian Times . I have
long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists. But they haven't been up to
anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks. Someone in the CPA
sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and
issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi. This is either
gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be
guessed at. There is a classical logical fallacy, post hoc ergo propter hoc (Z
happens after X, therefore Z is caused by X), and I keep revising this posting
this evening because I don't want to fall into it. But sometimes, of course,
when Z happens after X it is because of X. So I may as well just come out with
it: It is pretty suspicious, given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the
upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada:
' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant
Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group's
"striking arm" in Iraq. "I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity
which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas," Shiite cleric Muqtada
al-Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah, the leader of the militant
Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah. Last month, Nasrallah announced that his party
would close ranks with Hamas. "Let (Hamas) consider me their striking arm in
Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same," al-Sadr said during a
Friday prayer sermon in Kufa, his home base south of Baghdad. He did comment on
what he meant by the phrase. ' And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was
suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization, and the
Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization, which
leaves 7 US soldiers dead. The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget; but who
provoked it and why? I'm not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the
consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing. Anthony Shadid of the
Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months
be for. Why were they suddenly acted on Saturday? 

i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out. I definitely
could use a drink, actually a couple would probably do better. Bryan, you're in,

come from great people and have fantastic friends. In fact Peder and I were
remarking on how agreeable they all are as the sucked on our balls last night.
Fucking bitches!" 

i have to go to butt-fucking mississippi. i am not looking foward to that but

would you want a chihuahua? those dogs aren't even friendly. do you think they
are cool b/c of the taco bell dog? 

"Les Spahnn" <spahnn@hnks.com> 02/13/2001 08:02 PM All: It is my understanding,
from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to
expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter
into direct access contracts. The premise with which the administartion is
acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone's right to bilateral
contracts quickly, it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must
break through. In other words the table is set. Deal your meal from where the
dishes are located. I.E. the Davis Administration wants to place all direct
access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party
should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule
concerning how direct access should work for all parties. It clearly gives the
Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can
occur without having to say that they oppose direct access. Power be where power
lies.

Sean Boyle 08/17/2000 11:21 AM I spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their
RFP. Bruce indicated NiMo short listed five companies who all bid higher than
ENA. However, he also mentioned we were a close sixth, that is close to the
fifth highest bid. He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid. He
also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed
alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure. NiMo released an
additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter, I believe Phil should have
or be getting that RFP. Phil if you could please make copies and distribute
ASAP. Thanks, Sean Here you go. If you have any other questions, please let me

Marlene Hilliard 10/08/99 08:52 AM On or about September 23, 1999 a request for
service was placed by the above referenced counterparty. The request was for a
Intrastate Gas Transportation Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement.
These agreements were forwarded to the counterparty, CCNG, Inc.. On or about
October 6, 1999, Kelly Cloud, Senior Vice President of CCNG, Inc. (713)
235-1972, called and informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM, L.P..
Further, she informed me that Section 7 of the agreement, which reads in part:
Gas is free from liens and adverse claims of every kind, should be changed
because the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and/or is
subject to liens. She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another would
be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of Section 7.
Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7. Kelly Cloud
has instructed me to call with any further questions. Thanks. Marlene D.
Hilliard Ginny, Please see the attached guaranty. A clean and redlined version
are attached. I revised the language based on our discussions and added the
language concerning interest which we had both previously approved. We are OK to
execute this form. Let me know if acceptable and I will go ahead and execute.
Thanks. "Townsend, George" <gtownsend@manorisd.net> 03/27/2001 09:11 AM Puto,
What's going on dude? Antigua was awesome. I survived it without a problem.
Heather moving in has been a different story. I didn't realize how much "stuff"
you could pack into a one bedroom apartment. How is your love life. The gal from
the wedding was pretty hot. Are you still chasing that? Lets get together soon.
Our extra bedroom is nicer now. My old bed got tossed in a dumpster. It smelled
like shit. Talk to you later GT How is it going? Did you survive the honeymoon?
These look fine to me. Go ahead and forward to Brant if you are ready.

Glad to hear all is well. I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled
in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses. It
isn't about finding the meaning of life at work. It is all about the $$$. Work
hard. Make $$$. Retire young. Things with me are great. Moving back to Calgary
in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back
but when opportunity knocks you gotta go. Take care. I don't hear from you in
months and then you level me with such a thought provoking, soul searching
article. Thanks for thinking of me to send it to. I really enjoyed reading it.
We certainly fit into certain parts of the article. There are a few life
theories like that which working through. Its all interesting stuff. How are
things going with you? Are you enjoying Houston? London has been great.
Brokering over here has been pretty rewarding. Traders over here seem to have a
lot more respect for other humans. Catriona is well and has landed herself a
pretty cool job in PR. Keep in touch, Mike Michael J. McDermott

You have always been on the move seeking affectionate, satisfying and harmonious
relationships. Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union
in which there could be love, self-sacrifice and mutual trust. It has often been
said that "True love is just around the corner"...and maybe... if you haven't
found it as yet - you possibly soon will. In the past there have been .. and
maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without. You have now
decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you
greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem. You wear
your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt
to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little
affection ... but take care... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt
in the past...and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment.. Whatever
you strive to do, something always seems to be holding you back. There is no
subterfuge in you. You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life, in a
relationship, is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can, together,
develop a foundation of trust based on understanding. You are your own person...
and you demand freedom of thought ...to follow your own convictions. You have no
interest in "two-timing" and all you seek is sincerity and "straight-dealing".
You wish to be left in peace... no more conflict and no more differences of
opinion ... In fact you just don't want to be involved in any arguments of any
shape or form ... All you want is for "them" to get on with it - and to leave
you alone.. John, sorry for not sending it to you earlier (totally forgot to
open my outlook). Raw data is on the fisrt tab of the file to the right. Let me
know if you have any questions. Vladi. Hey Vladi, Do you still have the
historical nymex settle file that you created for Lavo's spread analysis? If you

Visit, Thanks for your message. Can you send me the data you used: I shall take
a look at it. Vince Dear All, My mane is Visit Phunnarungsi. I used to e-mail
Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article "The Challenge of Pricing and
Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives" and he had mailed me the copy. I am now
modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean
Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper "Making the most of
mean reversion" to estimate the mean reversion speed. I use Queensland
half-hourly price during 13 December, 1998-30 June 2001 giving about 44,000
price observations. However, the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as
expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept. The coefficient and
standard error are as followed: Intercept: -0.3931 (0.0076) Slope: 0.1171
(0.0022) R Square: 0.0585 Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate
as the estimated slope has the positive sign. I have also tried monthly data and
the results are the same. It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this
matter. Kindest regards, Visit Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at

Vince Traci, Thanks. This is the best solution given all the uncertainties we
face. Vince Vince - Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your
group. Right now, we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs
and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the
year. Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any
offers for the summer. What I would like to do in this case is get the
information to Jeff Davis, who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to
get Sungjoo's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like
to hire him for summer. When we start the summer process, we will interview the
candidate and slot him for your group. Is this okay with you? Hope all is well
with you Take Care Traci Traci, I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday. One of
the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship. He came
across as a very bright person, very personable. I can take him as a summer
intern. Vince Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski, Hi. How are you doing? I hope you have
a good flight back to home. It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and
its finance sector. Thank you for your time. I have already submitted my resume
and cover letter right after the talk. However, you ask me to send a copy of
resume and cover letter again. Those attachments are what I was asked. Again, it
was a good chance for me to get to know what I can do in this field and what I
have to more focus on in school. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon

later would work for us. Please let me know what time we could meet. Thank you,
Phillip Phillip, This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out
in the year following the termination event. The way the tax law works, the tax
basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the
day preceding notification to the transfer agent. As such, we will distribute
net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior
to notifying the transfer agent. We will be distributing the shares reflected on
your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares). If you
would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross
shares. Please let me know you preference. As you know, we are in the process of
transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt. As such, we have a CPA,
Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files. He has become
our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)
and the various plan provision amendments. If you would like, we can set up a
conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.
Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you. Thanks, Renee
Renee, Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units. It
is clear that the payment will be made in shares. However, I still don't
understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many
shares. The plan document under VII. Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value
of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price
of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and
such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock." Can you help
me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account. Thank
you, Phillip Allen Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline. I am
expecting to pay something in the $3,to $5,000 range. I would like to see the
quotes and a description of the work to be done. It is my understanding that
some rock will be removed and replaced with siding. If they are getting quotes
to put up new rock then we will need to clarify. Jacques is ready to drop in a
dollar amount on the release. If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to
go ahead and cut off the utilities. Hopefully things will go smoothly. Phillip

Allen Greg, I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with
the Nimitz post office. The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to
let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 &
walzem had both sold. Let me know what you think of this property. Also, let me
know of any other ideas about replacement property. Phillip Jim, Take a look at
this spreadsheet. I tried to calculate the IRR on the port Aransas and Roma post
offices. Is this how your clients usually evaluate these properties? The Roma
deal looks much better. Phillip Mery, This sounds better than the limitations
you were describing in the meeting. We should be able to work with this. Phillip

toll. Currently, Mercury and Venus is conjunct and the conjunction is being
closely aspected by Rahu. In Pakistan national chart besides the transit
affliction to transit Venus in the fourth house by FMs Rahu and Mercury, natal
Saturn and Venus are also under the close affliction of transit Rahu. This has
resulted in a major rail accident in Pakistan involving three trains and
involving more than 300 deaths. In Indian national chart besides the transit
affliction to transit Mercury by Rahu and Venus the natal Saturn and Venus are
also under the transit affliction of Rahu which has resulted into floods in many
parts of the country taking toll of human lives, properties, etc. V K Choudhry

based on the discount and services they get from the airlines. Corporate plans
are clubbed with other services through some agencies to provide better service
for their staff. Promotional discount airfare Some countries like Malaysia and
Singapore promote trading for foreign visitors during some part of the year.
During this period, they offer cheap air tickets to their country on certain
flights. If you can check with the other airlines during this period, you may
get excellent discount airfare, which may even surprise you. COMPLETE ARTICLE

Several years ago I developed a short paper and pencil screening test which, in
a small pilot study, discriminated between ADHD, LD, and control subjects. I
recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger
population and, subsequently, to make it available to any one who has access to
a computer and the Internet. The test itself is what is called a substitution
test. It has two parts, both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the
differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of
having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder. I am in need of test
subjects and hope you will take it. The test, along with an information form, is
available at: . I think a test like this one is much needed. A person can take
it directly instead of others completing behavioral checklists or a completing a
lengthy program intensive test like TOVA. Perhaps you are willing to recommend
this site and, if you have a website, place a link on your website. 

are there any sadists out there who share the same tastes as i do ? i dont know
what it is , but since a very young age i have had a strange but very gratifying
urge to torture or maime animals. i am deadly serious, i really do get sexual
releif from even hearing of torture of animals, now some people may call me a
brute or a coward but i cant help my true feelings. badger baiting is natrually
a huge turn on, so i thought a few words in this group might uncover some mutual
enthusiasts. sincere appologies to anyone who is offended by my request but my
request is genuine. ----== Posted via Newsfeed.Com - Unlimited-Uncensored-Secure

Greetings. My name is Bill Gottlieb: I'm a freelance journalist specializing in
health, with 30 years experience. I'm the author of three books (including the
1.3 million seller ALTERNATIVE CURES) and hundreds of magazine articles, and
worked for 20 years at Rodale Press, as a writer and as editor-in-chief of
Prevention and Rodale Books. Currently, I am writing a book on natural
supplements to aid weight loss, with Harry Preuss, MD, a Professor of Medicine
at Georgetown University; it is scheduled for publication by Broadway (Random
House) in January 2007. I am seeking anecdotes (first name, last initial) from
dieters who successfully used a natural supplement to assist their weight loss;
the therapeutic agents under discussion include HCA, MCT, green or oolong tea
extract, CLA, chromium, starch-blockers, chitosan, 5-HTP, hoodia and caralluma,
HMB, and BCAA. If you've successfully used any of these supplement to aid weight
loss, please write me at gottlie...@yahoo.com and let me know, telling me about
your experience. Thank you for your time and attention. Warm regards, Bill
Gottlieb 

Once upon a time (in 2001, to be specific), the Coca-Cola corporation built a
bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the state of Kerala. In
exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land, the mighty
corporation promised to bring the people great wealth. But within a few short
months, the village people began to notice their wells were running dry, so they
complained to the corporation. Coca-Cola calmed the concerns of the people and
attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free
fertilizer, saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams.
After several years of use, we arrive at the present day when the village people
have suddenly discovered the fertilizer is actually the bottling plant's waste
sludge and is laden with cadmium, a highly toxic, cancer-causing heavy metal.
The village soil and water are now too heavily contaminated to safely occupy
human life, so the plant was shut down last week. Moral of the story: Don't
drink Coke..........drink Pepsi! Just kidding, Pepsi is actually in the process
of being thrown out of India for similar crimes, as well. 

The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center (GNOFHAC) filed a housing
discrimination complaint against the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO)
last week. The complaint, filed with the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development, accuses HANO of violating a 2003 enforcement agreement
entered into between former St. Thomas Housing Development residents, the City
of New Orleans, HANO, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St. Thomas, now known as River Garden. The
current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified former St. Thomas
residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at River
Garden per the 2003 agreement. Upon return to New Orleans after the Hurricane
Katrina evacuation, former residents have been informed that there are no
available public housing units at River Garden because those units have been
reserved for HANO employees. Therefore, public housing residents have been
unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are
left homeless, as a result. "In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, affordable
housing in New Orleans is more scarce than ever. As such, it is essential that
HANO comply with 2003 enforcement agreement," said James Perry, GNOFHAC
Executive Director 

Crude-oil prices rose Wednesday as strengthening Hurricane Rita, now a Category
5 storm, threatened to disrupt oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. New York's
main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in November rose 60 cents to close
at 66.80 dollars per barrel. In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for
November delivery advanced 53 cents to 64.73 dollars. After brushing the Florida
Keys islands on Tuesday, Rita packed winds of about 240 kilometers an hour as it
headed across the Gulf of Mexico. The US National Hurricane Center said Rita was
"extremely dangerous" and could become a top-level category five storm on the
Saffir-Simpson scale. The storm threatened oil installations in the Gulf of
Mexico where about one-quarter of US oil operations are based. Oil companies
evacuated offshore facilities as the storm's progress kept global markets on
tenterhooks. In Texas, BP shut its 460,000 barrels per day refinery and Marathon
shut its 72,000 bpd plant. Valero said it was reducing rates at its 243,000 bpd
Texas City refinery and its 85,000 bpd Houston refinery. Exxon Mobil released
nonessential staff from two giant Texas plants. Last month, Katrina devastated
refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi and sent prices to a record high of
70.85 dollars a barrel. please support the link bellow which is excelnt ,thank

(New Scientist Space) NASA is looking to private companies to launch both
supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station, it announced this
week. [...] "It's not cost-effective doing station flights while at the same
time focusing on getting back to the Moon," says Brett Alexander, vice-president
of Transformational Space, one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to
the ISS. NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010, which only
leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS. Outsourcing these responsibilities
would be a wise alternative, considering the accomplishments of the private
sector regarding the space elevator . Although some may praise this as an
opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good, NASA seems
hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world. (New Scientist
Space) On 3 November, NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house
science committee that the agency expects to invest about $500 million in the
commercial cargo and crew project over five years. "That kind of a financial
incentive [...] will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge,"
Griffin said. "I hope that industry, if put to the test, can do better [than the
government], but I do not expect it," Griffin added. Only time will reveal
whether Griffin's expectations are either exceeded or confirmed. But seeing how
the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS
(at about a fifth of the cost), it would come to no surprise if corporate
America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government. --

Normally this author is semi-objective (what blogger is) but on the
Seattlepi.com (see source link) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded
that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border (which
includes East Jerusalem by the way). One thing is certain for sure. If Abbas
keeps up this "macho talk" he will kill potential peace talks and might as well
allow Hamas (which has probably done a better job at providing for the
Palestinians) rule the West Bank. AP Photo/Nasser Nasser Interim Palestinian
leader and the front-runner in the upcoming Jan. 9, 2005 presidential election
Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank
town of Ramallah, Saturday Dec. 25, 2004. Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat's
legacy, Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood. It seems that
the Palestinian leadership (upcoming) will not be a peace partner with Israel.
He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world, but to
Arafat himself. Listing his priorities, Abbas told supporters of the ruling
Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and
continue the struggle against Israel's partially completed West Bank barrier.
Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees
and their descendants. Abbas, a refugee himself from what is today the northern
Israeli city of Safed, called the refugee issue "very important and very
dangerous." Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel, I can say that
this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process. If Abbas
does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat,
then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will
ultimately suffer. Selah! -- Posted by Hidden Nook to Hidden Nook at 12/26/2004

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4281450.stm] (Hat Tip: Captains
Quarters ) (BBC) The Palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an
end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of
escalating violence. Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel, weeks after its
military withdrew from the territory. In response to the rockets, Israel resumed
its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes. Authorised by Ariel
Sharon to make "unrestricted" strikes, its military launched new missile attacks
overnight. It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round, unable
to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this
terrorist group. Mahmoud Zahar, Hamas's leader declared the cease fire after
Israel killed it's former leader, Muhammed Sheikh Khalil . Hamas has become
rather unpopular in Gaza, as many see the Israeli air strikes as a response
towards the rocket attacks upon Israeli soil. Egypt had a role to play as they
convinced Hamas to end the attacks, although the same can not be said of Islamic
Jihad . (Jerusalem Post) "We're not happy with Hamas's position at this stage
and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians," commented
Khader Habib, a senior Islamic Jihad official. "But it seems that Hamas has its
own political agenda." [...] "The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance
groups but with Israel's scheme to destroy the Palestinians' infrastructure,"
Habib said. "Hamas remains targeted by Israel, as in the past, and the Israeli
occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression. Israel wants to drive
the Palestinians toward civil war." Islamic Jihad has refused to recognized the
cease fire, and hopes to turn the Gaza strip "into a vast battlefield." Unless
President Mahmoud Abbas steps in, Gaza will probably look like a battle field by
the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error, although
currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take
responsibility for his inability to act. -- Posted by Hidden Nook to Hidden Nook

I have a male and female cockatiel, and there are 2 eggs in the bottom of the
cage, will they hatch? Most likely not, if there is not a bird sitting on the
eggs. This is hard to tell. Cockatiels can lay unfertilized eggs as well. Just
because you have a male and female, it cannot be guaranteed the two mated. You
can try picking up the eggs and holding it up against a very bright light. If
you see a dark spot in the egg, that means it is fertilized and will hatch if
cared for properly. Have fun. 

Why is the city called Miramar? I'm not sure about the origin of the name but
they are a lot of different cities with different and unique names like Miramar
so it's just a name. There's lots of towns called Miramar, it'd help alot if you
listed a state or some sort of context you're looking for it in. Here's two
examples: There's a Miramar in Florida, just north of Miami. There's also a
Miramar in California, the site of a rather large Air Force Base...Miramar
California is a bit north of San Diego.

for securities reasons by the US (no matter what the liberal revisionist
historians tell you). 

What is your cats name and why did you name him/her that? If you HAVE a cat of
course. My cats name is Twinky. When she was a tiny little kitten she looked
like those twinky snack cakes. She is a creme tabby and I've had her for over 2
years now. I have a siamese lynx name Star we called her that because she has a
star pattern on her face. And she is the STAR of the family. I love her. :) I
have a Norwegian Forest Cat that is named Achilles bc as a kitten he always
attacked your feet when you walked by! My cats Called Frank because the year we
got him was the year Frank Sinatra died He also had bright blue eyes like Frank
Sinatra did :) 

what does it mean when a veiled chameleon egg is soft? my female chameleon just
laid eggs yesterday and today some of the eggs are soft when i mean soft i mean
like not like ordinary chameleon eggs. They are probably infertile. If there is
no male they are probably infertile! If you take a flash light and shine it
through the eggs and you see nothing throw them away! If you do not they will
start to rot! If she has no male to fertilize the eggs, the eggs will aways be
infertile. if you do have a male but they are not in the same cage or breeding
but you touch him then her she will smell his sent and probably lay eggs. Hope
she stops laying eggs because she will get really skinny! If she continues! Hope
this helps 

I have 24hrs in San Francisco - what are the best sights to see in my short
time? I have a day stop-over in San Francisco and my wife want to see some of
the key sites. We are staying next to the airport which is located next to
BARTrail. We have limited time What are the best sights to see, geiven that we
only have a short time? (We check in early afternoon and we fly next day. ) Hop
onto a Hop On/Hop Off bus. It'll take you to all the major sites (GG Bridge,
Haight, Chinatown, etc) and you can get off anyplace you want to spend more time
at. Go to Goldstar.com and get tickets for about a third of the price. alcatraz
island Take a ferry ride!!! It's an amazing experience! 

Is it better to book a cruise online or by a travel agent? First time to go on A
cruise any and all info is appreciated Personally, I don't find a travel agent
to be of value to me as I am willing to put in the time doing research on the
internet. I have not had good experience with travel agents. They don't seem to
know anything but the hype they are told and the packages they have available to
them. The one time I actually booked through a travel agent I did not get all of
the amenities I had paid for. The few times I have consulted with a travel agent
I was able to find the same for less on my own, and more options than what they
were selling. So now I do not bother with them at all. best is using an online
travel agent 

My Hamster escaped.... NEED HELP NOW!? okay.... I have a dog and my mother is
really really terrified of hamsters. Well last night while I was sleeping, my
hamster escaped from his cage. He is in my room, but there are so many things
inside there, I dunno what to do. I have lots of containers in there. Anybody
give me ideas like a trap or something? Find him before he finds the dog food.
I'm not kidding , I once lost a hamster in my house 3 months later I walk down
in the basement and it was as big as a rat. It had been eating dog food the
whole time. It was huge and scared the crap out of me. Make sure he isn't
trapped somewhere & put a bowl of food out. He will come and eat Start cleaning
and start looking. 

can i have some indoor pet ideas please!!!!!!!!!!!!!? i want a small indoor pet
that my mother will let me have please help i want something cheap east to take
care of and something to hopefully fit in my room no pet is really easy to take
care of. they all need love and attn , food, proper surroundings etc. the
easiest thing would be a fish - but u need to clean the tank weekly, feed it the
right amt, etc etc x Having a pet isn't easy. You should treat all pets like
children. They require a lot of attention or they get fussy and tear stuff up.
If you want easy then go with a gold fish or hamster. I would go with a small
rodent such as a mouse, rat, hamster or gerbil if you want something you can
handle and hold. Fish are probably the easiest to take care of though. 

french male sensuality? Ive been dating a man from brittany france for a couple
of months now. He's been away for a week and I was thinking of waiting for him
in his apartment wearing only his dress shirt. Its still a fairly new
relationship and we havent had sex yet so its kind of a big deal. I just dont
want to freak him out or make him feel uncomfortable. Is it ok for a woman in
french culture to make the first move? What do french men find sexy? French
women are the ones to say yes, the way we say it is not usually as
straigthforward as you propose to do. Why not wait for him in a sexy dress with
lunch or dinner, or a light snack at his house. And you take it up from there.
Just make sure that it is a light meal with little alcohol.

banners, billboards and lots more. 

This is the best Mediterranean Restaurant in the West Valley, I have friend who
drive from central Phx to come here. 

The best pizza ever im fat so ive had a ton of pizza other than pizza from
chicago its the best 

WONDERFUL service. I have used them once and will use them in the future.
Beautiful work, fast shipping and great communication. 

They are out of business. Nice people... I hear. Calls are now forwarded to
Malcolm Smith Motorsports down the road. 

professional Good job very professional. It made me feel good to see people work
so hard to take care of others belongings. 

Not a clothing store Be more careful when you write reviews- this is an
accounting group, not Hollister the clothing store. 

Favorite Restaurant Best yellow curry that I have ever tasted. Staff is super
friendly and very attentive. Price is also very reasonable. 

Great service A very well established service with a satisfying outcome. A well
communicated and will be hireing again for another projects...... Thanks

tropics for my companies next event!

Clean rooms, great for the price and cheapest on the exit. The front desk staff
was very pleasant and efficient. Serves FREE breakfast ! 

Buyer Beware!! Rusted out and unsafe cars sold here! Have a real mechanic check
before you buy!!!! Save money and go somewhere else! 

Great place for embroidery. Service was friendly and VERY fast. I purchased four
gift items there and had them all embroidered within a week. 

They have good sushi for a good price. My favorite so far in Bellevue. Store is
on the small side and atmosphere is just average. 

It's now called Sushi Lover. Food is just okay..won't crave it, but wouldn't
mind coming back for a quick meal. 

Good food and very friendly staff. Very good with my 5 year old daughter.
Interesting good value wine list to. Beer a bit expensive. 

Brain Dead Not only are these people completely inefficient and ineffective, but
they just don't give a darn. This place is a complete embarrassment. 

My favorite place to eat. The Atmosphere is the best.. Italian music, candles,
helpful and friendly staff... And the food is beautiful too ! 

Excellent piano lessons I'm very happy with the piano lessons Mrs. Lynda Mcmanus
taught me. Now I'm able to play the piano pretty well. 

Excellent Pizza!! Its the only pizza place I recommend in Woodland Hills. Yum.
My wife and kids can't get enough. Highly recommended. 

Worst place flour tortillas are always hard the beef enchiladas are discussing
meat all over cooked was good many yrs ago but restaurant has gone down hill 

I'm really surprised by the negative reviews. We've had about 5 repairs done on
3 different laptops. They've always been timely and inexpensive. 

Awsome! Great food cheap Every thing here is good. Fish tacos are my fave simple
and filling Highly recommend Mi Pueblo. Gets busy so come early 

Good local bikeshop Good local bike shop . Jason and the boys can do about
anything you need. The shop is located just off the river road . 

Best Pizzas and Calzones in the City! What a hidden gem! The food is superb and
they were delivered nice and hot! I highly recommend this place! 

This place is clean and well run with great people. The food is fresh and taste
great. Great value and service. We will be back again and again !! 

Great Service and hairstyles that last. I am pleased with the service that i get
at Luxe. The staff is very pleasant and my hair is always fresh. 

Nice teachers good school They are very good teachers and nice people to meet
here. I enjoyed very much to study here. A good place to improve your English 

Great Neighborhood Hangout Great place to catch a band or catch up with friends.
Ice cold beer and good prices. Kitchen puts out good food and has daily
specials. 

Poor Service After firing this company my next pool service found the filters
had not been cleaned as they should have been. I would recommend not using this
company. 

Buyer beware Do not use these guys. They'll tell you one thing then $5,000 later
do another. Lied right to my face then denied it. Run away. 

Great service I had a dead battery last week and called this company since they
were the closest they had very quick service for a Monday morning, thanks again
guys. 

I won a golf lesson certificate with Adz through a charity auction. The lesson
was donated by the teacher Adz. So i booked the lesson and loved it. Great
teacher. 

SERVERS When my server crashed, Greg worked from 7 PM until 4 AM and had my
company up and running the next morning. That's what I call customer service! 

It's fine for... It's fine for mass-market chocolate, but with companies like
Scharffen Berger, TCHO, and smaller artisan chocolate makers in the area, why? 

Rip Off! 45p for tap water! Ridiculous! Don't think I've ever been charged
before. Oh, and salad cream, not mayonnaise, on the coleslaw. Avoid! 

Slice Pizza at former Britt's Location Britt's Pizza is long gone. Their
location, the northwest corner of S. 10th & Federal Sts., is now home to Slice
Pizza. 

VERYYYY!!!! VERYYY!! Good auto repair men. Do the job honest and quickly as
possible. Would 100% recomend to others for a great service. Thank You Barrys
Auto Tech! 

A Great Help! Ashdown Horse Transport were fantastic! Very friendly and ALWAY
contactable even at weekends. I would hesitate to recommend anyone. Thanks again
Nina. PS. Love the new website! 

Miami's best tutoring service! My son was able to advance a full two grades
within 9 months! A wonderful tutoring service for students needing help with
elementary - middle school work. 

Food - very good for a midnight meal that isn't fast food. Service - the workers
are usually pleasant. Atmosphere is always fun, the assortment of customers adds
entertainment to the meal 

awesome place!!! it was worth of the ride more than an hour...I had so many
strawberries right on the field...strongly recomend...dont forget to try their
great ice cream 

wrong location this is not where the Blue Water Bridge Duty Free is located. It
is, surprisingly, near the Blue Water Bridges, some miles to the west of this
location. 

such a great idea this was, so easy to load and pack, no ramp, no step up no
back aches. moving with a pod was the best moving experience i have had. 

Totally flavored The statement about "best hamburguers in town" can be even
amplifiaed to "best hamburguers in world" Totally worth, juicy, big, fresh, and
excellent customer service! 

Best Cigar lounge on the blouvard. Encino has been blessed by the opening of
this smoke shop most definately. If you mention the name Amir you will receive
%10 off at time of purchase 

Doctor Hank is Amazing Our family has been trusting Doctor Hank with our teeth
for the last seven years. I wouldn't go to anyone else. Everyone on staff is
very professional and friendly. 

Stayed in the Seaview room here in December 2009! WOW what stunning views. The
furnishing and finishes are great. I highly recommend Bay View if you are
looking for Accommodation in Camps Bay. 

Surprisingly, this little strip mall restaurant has the best sushi I've found in
the Tampa area. It's fresh and really tasty. I'll drive an hour just for their
volcano, yum! 

Fantastic Nova Scotia Cottage We had a fantastic time. Such a relaxing
atmosphere and inspiring architecture. Sand Hill park was a great beach... Nice
warm water. Thank-You for sharing your cottage! 

Great lunch specials. Delivery is lightning fast. Perfect since I'm on a budget.
But otherwise, it can feel pricey for what you get. Like the sushi, don't like
the pad thai. 

Holly - the owner, knows exactly how to make you feel beautiful in clothes.
Stylish and contemporary, no matter your size or personality type. She's an A+
and so are her clothes! 

Very poor customer service.There are a couple decent people working there, but
the rest are VERY dishonest, as well as rude, I have yet to hear the truth come
out of their mouths. 

Give them a try! The pizzas are huge and super delicious. They're our favorite
pizza place to order from... and they're a local, family owned company! How much
better does it get?! 

I loved the atmosphere here and the food is good, however the tables are so
close together that it feels very cramped. We were made to feel very welcome.
Well worth a visit. http://cambridgefoodfrivolity.blogspot.com/ 

Great Service Dr Mcdonald is wonderful. She answers all questions asked and
provides the best service i have ever seen. I have a new born daughter and she
helped me with a lot. Good Job DR. 

Called to check if they had a product I've been using on my dog for years... the
boy who answered the phone couldn't possibly have been ruder to me. I will never
come here again. 

I am a new patient. I have visited Dr. Cooper's office twice and I am very
impressed with how friendly and polite the staff is. I found the office to be
very clean and professional-looking. 

Want a great burger? The smokehouse can't be beat anywhere. Salad bar is hit and
miss for freshness - sometimes the broccoli looks browned around the edges.
Never a bad smokehouse burger though! I crave those. 

Natasha is the BEST photographer we have ever worked with. She has a great way
with children and is able to capture their personality as well as many
spontaneous images. You will not be disappointed with her work!! 

Ray's pizza : my favorite Ray's Pizza is just too good. I wish I could have a
slice for every single meal. Luckily I live very close, so I can abuse it during
week-ends... 

Caldwell insurance has been doing our insurance for a couple years now and they
have been extremely thorough. We've only had one urgent issue to deal with and
they were very prompt in their response. Highly recommend! 

Lovely Cottage This cottage is a charming homely, friendly, place to stay. Mary
is an excellent host who does yummy breakfasts. My room was delightful and the
attention to detail was amazing. Will come again! Sophie. 

Cheap Hotel Rome - Thanks for all your help! Cheap Hotel Rome - thanks for
finding us a hotel at the last minute. We had a great stay, your service was
excellent and we will use you again! 

The best photographer in Miami I was soooo lucky to have used Marlon's
photography services....such a creative and talented photographer and a pleasure
to work with. The images turned out amazing. I definitely recommend him :) 

Great Meal Happened on to this place while out of town on business, and it was
great! The food was excellent and the service was terrific. It is a cloth napkin
kind of place, but I thought well worth it. 

Friendly Efficient and overall great place for people in chronic intractable
pain Great place for people in chronic pain. Staff is very friendly they treat
you like a human being and not just another patient. Very efficient at treating
chronic pain! 

The best company in Phuket for creating website and e-commerce website. From
first meeting with them to launch of my website, everything went smooth and on
schedule. Highly recommended for who wants to have website. Great with SEO as
well. 

Great Place To Use The Fix appliances Plumbing Air Conditioning & Electric
Problems. We have used them for plumbing & A/C and they are affordable and get
the work done right. Great place 5 stars for sure. Thanks From Bill 

I used Birdies for our Annual Walk Against Drugs and Alcohol event. They were
very professional, neat and clean. They came through on all of their promises
and we had a very successful day. I will be using Bridies again. 

ONe of a few. Hancocks is one of four fabric stores in Fort Smith. We have Hobby
Lobby, Just for Fun Fabrics, Walmart, and Interior Mall just inside Barling.
They do have a good selection of fabric and notions. 

It was ok, nice management, they let us check in early, but the place was old.
It was clean, but just a little dumpy. Lots of room for big rig parking. Hard to
get into though because of road construction. 

I'll admit I wasn't expecting much from this place, but they really did do a
good job. The chicken cordon-blu was tasty and came in a huge portion size for
the money. Service was a touch slow, but friendly. 

find another place Run down. Dark, dark main room. No way to read/relax.
'Electric' blanket on one bed did not heat. Quite cold. Removing 90% of
'sit-abouts' in main room would look cleaner. 

recommended Excellent location. Good sports bar. Hyatt web site improved.
Accurate check-out. Rooms clean. Lifts quick, clean, accurate, and correctly
sized. Choose this hotel over the Hilton (which is on the next block). 

Summary: Not cheep, but very fast, and super friendly service. Quality of work
is sufficient but not outstanding. Like all oil place changes, ask/recommend the
100 other services they have. Will be a repeat customer with discount coupons. 

criminal defense lawyer Mr. Villega is an exceptional California criminal
defense lawyer. He cross examined witnesses relentlessly and had them break down
and tell the truth. If you want an attorney who will defend your right, contact
Law Offices of Armando Villega 

Checked in real late, but staff was very kind and helpful. Rooms very clean and
smelled very fresh. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. I loved my stay here
and if ever back in the area, I will be staying here again. 

Thanks for following me around the store Enough said. I don't steal, I wasn't
acting suspiciously. I was ready to buy a new jacket, a new sweater and a couple
of your overpriced belts and I walked out because of your obvious lurking 

Best meat pies in Canada If you are looking for authentic British meat pies,
then look know further. I especially like the Chicken Curry pie. Good Food. The
owner/baker, "Pie Guy" is a hoot to deal with as well. Mo 

Fantastic fresh food! What a neat gem of a restaurant in a corner one wouldn't
expect it. Cozy, warm atmosphere, great service. Most importantly, the food was
outstanding. It clearly had been prepared from fresh ingredients. We'll be back
often. 

Thanks For A Great Job Thanks For The Prompt Service And Great Job You And Your
Boys Have Done On Our New Solar System, The Panels On The Roof Look Great And
The Power We Are Putting Back In To The Grid Is Great, Great Job Thanks 

impressive truly impressive The First time I walked in there with my teacup
chihuahua puppy I knew I'd be here a lot. Pets Discount has lovely employees, a
wonderful grooming service, and everything I need to keep my dog in tip top
condition! 

Excellent service! I am so glad that we now have a good nail shop on San Mateo
Avenue! No more having to drive to San Francisco for a great mani pedi. Both
Tina and Vicky are excellent. I will definitely refer my friends and family:) 

great! :P you get a really good view of the city and there is also attractions
like simulator, short movies. Try the 360 restraunt u spin in the cn tower with
a beautiful view the sky pod elevator is about an hour line up in the summer 

GREAT Store GREAT Service! “This store is great!! I love walking in and not
being hassled. I was there when they did a free raffle in August and I won a
hard drive! The reason I go back is because the employees are sooooo nice.” 

Horrible customer service. I came in to get a nice gift for my wife. The one guy
who was there, I'm guessing was the owner, was probably the least helpful person
I've ever met. But thankfully there are other flowers shops around Norman. 

Pure Beauty What a joy to stroll off historic Canyon Road in Santa Fe into a
gallery with a gorgeous diversity of art. Destiny Allison's metal sculptures
were my favorite.The owner Karla is welcoming and fun. Give yourself the gift of
visiting Winterowd Fine Art! 

Great Place! This is one of my favorite places to eat for lunch. They offer a
good portions at a great price, it's enough food to fill you up, but you don't
ever feel like you ate too much. Plus, it's super healthy! 

Barb does an AMAZING JOB, she is always learning new things on how to use her
hands and body, to give every person an AWESOME MASSAGE, CALL TODAY AND SCHEDULE
YOU MUST SEE HER, YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE SHE IS THE BEST OF THE BEST ! 

If you want cheaply made glass from India and China, this is not your place.
These people only carry the very best American blown glass. Their selection is
top notch and the staff is very knowledgable. Go to the Looking Glass for all
your smoking needs!!!!!!!!!! 

Chuck and Gretchen were very positive, and when Alan's refused to work on my
bike, Chuck came right out and saw the problem and did what Alan's mechanic
wouldn't do. He worked on it right on the back of my car. I am extremely pleased

Quick and Cheap Walked in and was outta there in 10 mins with a really good deal
i thought i was going to be paying alot because i had a DUI but with my DUI and
Sr-22 they were able to get me the best deal out there. 

Is not a service office This is a delivery office only and does not take walk
ins but they do have a blue box out front. Glad I called before I arrived with
my box to ship. Thought adding a comment would save someone the hassle with a
useless trip there. 

the food is mediocre at best. the waitress took my name and then called me that
all night. not sure how I feel about that one. it's passable as a pub, but the
pizza is not that great. if you want good pizza, go to famoso. seriously. 

Anyone else find it a little suspicious that there are not only 20 reviews for
this dentist (a HUGE number compared to the others in the area), but that they
all have the same unique grammar structure? And they seem to be posted at fairly
regular intervals? 

Best YET! We go to Japaneiro's all the time and we have NEVER been disappointed!
Wait staff is always ready to help if you can't decide (which happens every time
for me d/t the huge menu of rolls) and always courteous! Soooo tasty! 

Good honest wrok Harlan provides great service. He is very knowledgeable and
took the time to explain the repairs to me. The work on my car was done quickly
and I felt I could trust his work. I have nothing but fantastic things to say. I
highly recommend his shop. 

Best in Memphis This shop is by far the best I have been to. I have a
Saab...which everything is expensive on and they have been extrememly fair and
price alot lower than any other shop I called. They are the only place I would
take my car peiod. 

Took a laptop in for a video cable to be replaced. Everything except the display
worked fine before I took it in. The video cable was replaced and suddenly the
motherboard was dead. Phone calls weren't returned when promised and the botched
repair took a week longer than promised. 

We have stayed at Tanglewood for many years now. We go over about 5 times a
year. We have never had a problem with the cabins. They are always so helpful.
The cabins have always been clean. Helen is a wonderful place to take you
family. We recommend these cabins! 

Can't say enough I used to tan down the street before I was referred to this
place by one of my friends. WOW! I didn't know what I was missing. The lowest
bed here is better than my last salons highest level. Salon is clean and girls
are nice. 

Great People and even better service! Best to deal with! In a few words ... I'm
pleasantly surprised that you can still find "old school" service out there
where company care more about good name and customers than their pockets...
Highly recommended people / business. Thanks Josh! 

Dentist you can trust If possible I try the services on myself before I bring in
my son. Drs. Ali work wonders.Neither me nor my son haven't had a single cavity
since we started dental care there. The team focus is prevention and education.
That alone makes them unique. 

This is not your usual cheap hotdog place. They offer a large variety of quality
hotdogs and hamburgers They also offer veggie dogs. The fries are of good
quality, the staff is friendly. The atmosphere is your typical indie outfit with
old movie posters and memorabilia from the 70's and 80's. 

Over charged. I used my card to purchase a meal on the menu and the total on my
receipt was $8.95 but when I went on line to check my transaction it show

Elmira, your the best! All I can say is that Elmira you are the best Ive
experienced, never before has the seamstress done a perfect job until i met you.
I recommend you to everyone in Calgary, as she is a professional and the cost
for her was low. 

5 star detail job I took my Mustang here and it looked amazing after they were
done, they did a great job, I'm very satisfied with the results. The paint and
wheels looked like glass and the interior looked new! Also, they have great
customer service and a very knowledgeable staff
